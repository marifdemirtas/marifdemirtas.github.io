      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to attend CHI 2024 in person in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi. My second in-person conference (after SIGCSE 2024 in Portland), and one of the flagship conferences of the largest ACM Special Interest Group (SIGCHI) with more than 3200 in-person participants, this was such an exciting and inspiring experience with so many amazing works and many more amazing people that I had to note down some highlights before they get lost within the pages of my notebook.</description>
