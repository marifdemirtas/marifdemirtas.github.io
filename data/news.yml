  title: "üéä Our paper ''Validating, Refining, and Identifying Programming Plans Using Learning Curve Analysis on Code Writing Data'' is accepted at ICER 2024!"
  content: "In this paper, we focused on programming plans as a potential knowledge component model with my co-authors Max Fowler, Nicole Hu, and Katie Cunningham.
  Our analysis provides a tool to visualize students' plan acquisition process and evaluate plans on how well students can apply them to solve new problems. Preprint [here](http://trailslab.web.illinois.edu/pubs/ICER2024_ValidatingPlanswithLCA.pdf)."

  title: "üéä Our paper ''Reexamining Learning Curve Analysis in Programming Education: The Value of Many Small Problems'' is accepted at EDM 2024!"
  content: "In this work, we replicated [Kelly Rivers et al.'s 2016 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2960310.2960333) with my co-authors Max Fowler and Katie Cunningham. 
  Surprisingly, we found that AST nodes can model skill acquisition to a promising extent, contrary to prior findings, especially in courses with many short programming exercises. 
  Our preprint is available [here](https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/y4tqr)."
