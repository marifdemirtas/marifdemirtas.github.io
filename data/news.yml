  title: "üéä Our paper ''Reexamining Learning Curve Analysis in Programming Education: The Value of Many Small Problems'' is accepted at EDM 2024!"
  content: "In this work, we replicated [Kelly Rivers et al.'s 2016 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2960310.2960333) with my co-authors Max Fowler and Katie Cunningham. 
  Surprisingly, we found that AST nodes can model skill acquisition to a promising extent, contrary to prior findings, especially in courses with many short programming exercises. 
  Our preprint is available [here](tbd)."
