## Hi, I'm **Arif**!
I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a focus on **computing education research** and **human computer interaction**, advised by [Dr. Katie Cunningham](https://www.kicunningham.com/). 

I'm interested in having a better understanding of 
- how students learn programming 💻
- what obstacles they face and how we can address these to broaden participation in CS 🌍
- how we can design technologies to aid their learning process 📚
