## Experience

- Research Engineer @ [Vitamu](https://vitamu.com/) | (April 2022 - June 2023)
	* Worked on developing learning-based algorithms for breast cancer detection and localization from digital mammography imaging.
	* Installed training environments on cloud for computationally demanding models using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
	* Implemented configuration management servers using Puppet to automatically deploy development environments on
	 Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
	* Deployed a production prototype on cloud using Docker.

- R&D Engineer @ [Yapi Kredi Teknoloji](https://www.ykteknoloji.com.tr/en/) | (August 2021 - April 2022)
	* Working in the NLP team under the R&D department.
	* Contributed to [_SAFIR_](https://www.researchgate.net/project/SAFIR-Smart-Algorithms-for-Information-Retrieval), which is a tool developed for information extraction from banking documents using a multimodal approach.
	* Proposed an approach for parsing relations between pages in multi-page trade documents based on multimodal embeddings, presented at **ICPR 2022** and available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9956546).

- Research Intern @ [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://reyhaneh.cs.illinois.edu/) | (June 2021 - March 2022)
	* Working on the testing of autonomous driving systems (ADS) with **Dr. Reyhaneh Jabbarvand**.
	* Developed a test generation framework in _Python_ using an open source autonomous driving simulator ([SVL by LG](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/)).
	* Evaluating the test generation framework on [Apollo ADS by Baidu](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo) to test the coverage and efficiency of generated tests and see the effects of the introduced methods.

- Research Intern @ [BASIRA Lab, ITU](https://basira-lab.com/) | (December 2020 - May 2021)
	* Worked on a geometric deep learning project with **Dr. Islem Rekik**.
	* Proposed a novel method for behavioral score prediction from brain graphs using graph neural networks with collaborators from Germany and Tunisia.
	* Conducted experiments of the proposed method in _Python_ and _Pytorch Geometric_.
	* Co-authored the paper explaining the method, [published in Brain Imaging and Behavior (IF: 3.39)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-021-00585-7).

- Research Intern @ [Cryptography, Security, and Privacy Research Group, Koc University](https://crypto.ku.edu.tr/) | (July 2020 - October 2020)
	* Worked on a game theory project supervised by **Assoc. Prof. Alptekin Küpçü**.
	* Reviewed the game theory literature on commitment with a team of 4 interns.
	* Developed a web application for playing Prisoner's Dilemma variants with custom constraints against other people using _JavaScript_ and _Node.js_.
